# DeepOrchestration

### It is a cool project using deep learning to help ochestration

### The first try is to implement cnn
- take 2 instruments from TinySOL and then combine 
- take melspectrogram feature (128*128, if the combined pieces are small, just add zeros)
- a multi-label model used to take the loss from both instruments
- after 30 epochs training on cpu, accuracy results shown as follow
